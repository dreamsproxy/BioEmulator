This version makes the tanh activations as a gated activation method
Where, activation thresholds are implemented as follows:
    TanH activation thresholds:
        (-0.49, 0.49)

Perhaps an adaptive method where:
    The more times the TanH fires in the last n steps:
    the higher the threshold
        Threshold can be scaled via:
            Thresh += thresh * 0.0271
